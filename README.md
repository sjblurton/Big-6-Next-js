> Big 6 Progressive calisthenics

Big 6 Progressive calisthenics fitness app, is based on a book by Paul Wade, called Convict Conditioning. It's a great book and a training routine I've been following for a while now. I needed a way to track my progress. So i built this app in order to help me master the one arm handstand push-up!
